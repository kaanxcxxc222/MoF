A PyTorch implementation of Flow Matching Mixture of Experts, a novel neural network architecture that integrates continuous normalizing flows with sparse mixture of experts routing for enhanced representational capacity in deep learning models.

---

## Abstract

Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have demonstrated remarkable success in scaling neural networks by activating only a subset of parameters per input. However, traditional MoE implementations rely on standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as expert networks, which may limit the expressiveness of learned transformations. This work introduces **Flow Matching Mixture of Experts (FM-MoE)**, a framework that replaces conventional MLP experts with flow matching networks. Each expert learns a continuous transformation through an ordinary differential equation (ODE), enabling more expressive feature mappings while maintaining the computational efficiency of sparse expert selection.


## Installation

```bash
pip install mixture-of-flows
```


## Usage


```python
import torch
from mixture_of_flows import FlowMatchingMoE, FlowMatchingMoEConfig

# Define configuration
config = FlowMatchingMoEConfig(
    input_dim=512,
    hidden_dim=2048,
    num_experts=8,
    num_selected=2,
    flow_steps=10,
)

# Create model
model = FlowMatchingMoE(config)

# Forward pass
x = torch.randn(4, 128, 512)  # (batch_size, seq_len, input_dim)
output, aux_loss = model(x)

print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")  # (4, 128, 512)
print(f"Auxiliary loss: {aux_loss.item():.6f}")
```

## Introduction


**Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models partition the input space among specialized sub-networks (experts), with a gating mechanism that routes each input to a subset of experts. This approach enables conditional computation, where only a fraction of model parameters are activated for any given input, allowing for significant scaling of model capacity without proportional increases in computational cost (Shazeer et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2022).

**Flow Matching** is a simulation-free approach to training continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). Unlike traditional normalizing flows that require explicit invertibility constraints or simulation during training, flow matching learns a velocity field that transports samples from a source distribution to a target distribution along optimal transport paths (Lipman et al., 2023).

### Motivation

Traditional MoE architectures employ feed-forward networks as experts, which apply fixed, discrete transformations to inputs. By replacing these with flow matching networks, FM-MoE enables each expert to learn a continuous, time-dependent transformation governed by:

```
dx/dt = v_theta(x, t), where t in [0, 1]
```

This formulation provides several theoretical and practical advantages:

1. **Enhanced Expressiveness**: Continuous transformations can represent more complex mappings than discrete layer compositions
2. **Smooth Interpolation**: The ODE formulation ensures smooth transitions in the learned representation space
3. **Flexible Computation**: Integration steps can be adjusted at inference time for accuracy-efficiency trade-offs

## Mathematical Formulation

### Flow Matching Fundamentals

Flow matching learns a time-dependent velocity field `v_theta(x, t)` that defines an ordinary differential equation:

```
dx/dt = v_theta(x, t),    t in [0, 1]
```

The transformation from input `x_0` to output `x_1` is obtained by integrating this ODE:

```
x_1 = x_0 + integral from 0 to 1 of v_theta(x(t), t) dt
```

### Numerical Integration

We employ the Euler method for numerical integration with `N` steps:

```
x_{n+1} = x_n + v_theta(x_n, t_n) * dt

where:
  - dt = 1/N (step size)
  - t_n = n * dt (time at step n)
  - n in {0, 1, ..., N-1}
```

### Expert Routing

Given input `x in R^d`, the router computes expert probabilities:

```
p(e|x) = softmax(W_r * x)_e,    e in {1, ..., E}
```

The top-k experts are selected based on these probabilities:

```
S(x) = argmax_k { p(e|x) : e in {1, ..., E} }
```

### Mixture Computation

The final output combines selected expert outputs:

```
y = sum over e in S(x) of [ p_norm(e|x) * f_e(x) ]

where:
  - f_e(x) is the flow transformation of expert e
  - p_norm(e|x) = p(e|x) / sum over e' in S(x) of p(e'|x)
```

### Auxiliary Losses

#### Load Balancing Loss

Encourages uniform expert utilization:

```
L_balance = E * sum from e=1 to E of (p_bar_e - 1/E)^2

where p_bar_e = (1/BL) * sum over b,l of p(e|x_{b,l})
```

#### Router Z-Loss

Prevents large logit values for training stability:

```
L_z = (1/BL) * sum over b,l of (log(sum over e of exp(z_{b,l,e})))^2
```

### Time Embedding

Sinusoidal positional encoding for continuous time:

```
PE(t, 2i) = sin(t / 10000^(2i/d))
PE(t, 2i+1) = cos(t / 10000^(2i/d))
```
